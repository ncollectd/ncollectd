.Sh NAME
.Nm ncollectd
.Nd System statistics collection daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ncollectd
.Op Fl tTfh
.Op Fl C Ar config-file
.Op Fl P Ar pid-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
\fBncollectd\fP is a daemon that receives system statistics and makes them
available in a number of ways.
The main daemon itself doesn't have any real functionality apart from loading,
querying and submitting to plugins.
For a description of available plugins please see \fBPLUGINS\fP below.
.Sh OPTIONS
Most of ncollectd's configuration is done using using a configfile.
See
.Xr ncollectd.conf 5
for an in-depth description of all options.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fB\-C\fR \fI\,config\-file\/\fR
Specify an alternative config file.
This is the place to go when you wish to change \fBncollectd\fP's behavior.
The path may be relative to the current working directory.
.It \fB\-t\fR
Test the configuration only.
The program immediately exits after parsing the config file.
A return code not equal to zero indicates an error.
.It \fB\-T\fR
Test the plugin read callbacks only.
The program immediately exits after invoking the read callbacks once.
A return code not equal to zero indicates an error.
.It \fB\-P\fR \fI\,pid\-file\/\fR
Specify an alternative pid file.
This overwrites any settings in the config file.
This is thought for init-scripts that require the PID\-file in a certain
directory to work correctly.
For everyday-usage use the \fBpid\-file\fR config\-option.
.It \fB\-B\fR
If set, ncollectd will \fI\,not\/\fR try to create its base directory.
If the base directory does not exist, it will exit rather than trying
to create the directory.
.It \fB\-f\fR
Don't fork to the background.
\fIncollectd\fR will also \fB\,not\/\fR close standard file descriptors,
detach from the session nor write a pid file.
This is mainly thought for 'supervising' init replacements such as \fIrunit\fP.
If using \fIupstart\fP or \fIsystemd\fP though.
.It \fB\-h\fR
Output usage information and exit.
.El
.Sh PLUGINS
As noted above, the real power of ncollectd lies within its plugins.
A (hopefully complete) list of plugins and short descriptions can be found
in the \f(CWREADME\fP file that is distributed with the sourcecode.
.Pp
There are two big groups of plugins, \fIinput\fP and \fIoutput\fP plugins:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBinput\fP
Input plugins are queried periodically.
They somehow acquire the current value of whatever they where designed to
work with and submit these values back to the daemon, i. e. they "dispatch"
the values.
As an example, the \f(CWcpu plugin\fP reads the current cpu-counters of time
spent in the various modes (user, system, nice, ...) and dispatches these
counters to the daemon.
.It \fBoutput\fP
Output plugins get the dispatched values from the daemon and does something
with them, can handle notifications and logging.
.El
.Sh SIGNALS
\fB\,ncollectd\/\fR accepts the following signals:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fB\,SIGINT\/\fR, \fB\,SIGTERM\/\fR
These signals cause \fBncollectd\fP to shut down all plugins and terminate.
