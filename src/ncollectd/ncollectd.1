.SH NAME
ncollectd \- System statistics collection daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ncollectd [OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ncollectd
is a daemon that receives system statistics and makes them available
in a number of ways. The main daemon itself doesn't have any real functionality
apart from loading, querying and submitting to plugins. For a description of
available plugins please see
.B PLUGINS
below.
.SH OPTIONS
Most of ncollectd's configuration is done using using a configfile. See
.BR ncollectd.conf (5)
for an in-depth description of all options.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR \fI\,config\-file\/\fR
Specify an alternative config file. This is the place to go when you wish to
change \fBncollectd\fR's behavior. The path may be relative to the current working
directory.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
Test the configuration only. The program immediately exits after parsing the
config file. A return code not equal to zero indicates an error.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR
Test the plugin read callbacks only. The program immediately exits after invoking
the read callbacks once. A return code not equal to zero indicates an error.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR \fI\,pid\-file\/\fR
Specify an alternative pid file. This overwrites any settings in the config
file. This is thought for init-scripts that require the PID\-file in a certain
directory to work correctly. For everyday-usage use the \fBpid\-file\fR
config\-option.
.TP
\fB\-B\fR
If set, ncollectd will \fI\,not\/\fR try to create its base directory. If the base
directory does not exist, it will exit rather than trying to create the
directory.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Don't fork to the background. \fIncollectd\fR will also \fB\,not\/\fR close standard file
descriptors, detach from the session nor write a pid file. This is mainly
thought for 'supervising' init replacements such as \fIrunit\fP. If using
\fIupstart\fP or \fIsystemd\fP though.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Output usage information and exit.
.SS PLUGINS
As noted above, the real power of ncollectd lies within its plugins. A
(hopefully complete) list of plugins and short descriptions can be found in the
\f(CWREADME\fP file that is distributed with the sourcecode.

There are two big groups of plugins, \fIinput\fP and \fIoutput\fP plugins:
.TP
\fBinput\fP
Input plugins are queried periodically. They somehow acquire the current value
of whatever they where designed to work with and submit these values back to
the daemon, i. e. they "dispatch" the values. As an example, the \f(CWcpu plugin\fP
reads the current cpu-counters of time spent in the various modes (user,
system, nice, ...) and dispatches these counters to the daemon.
.TP
\fBoutput\fP
Output plugins get the dispatched values from the daemon and does something
with them, can handle notifications and logging.

.SH SIGNALS
\fB\,ncollectd\/\fR accepts the following signals:
.TP
\fB\,SIGINT\/\fR, \fB\,SIGTERM\/\fR
These signals cause \fBncollectd\fP to shut down all plugins and terminate.
