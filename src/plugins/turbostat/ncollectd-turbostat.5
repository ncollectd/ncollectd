.Sh DESCRIPTION
The \fBturbostat\fP plugin reads CPU frequency and C-state residency on modern
Intel processors by using \fIModel Specific Registers\fP.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBcore-cstates\fP \fIbitmask\fP
Bit mask of the list of core C-states supported by the processor.
This option should only be used if the automated detection fails.
Default value extracted from the CPU model and family.
.Pp
Currently supported C-states (by this plugin): 3, 6, 7
.Pp
All states (3, 6 and 7): (1<<3) + (1<<6) + (1<<7) = 392
.It \fBpackage-cstates\fP \fIbitmask\fP
Bit mask of the list of packages C-states supported by the processor.
This option should only be used if the automated detection fails.
Default value extracted from the CPU model and family.
.Pp
Currently supported C-states (by this plugin): 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
.Pp
States 2, 3, 6 and 7: (1<<2) + (1<<3) + (1<<6) + (1<<7) = 396
.It \fBsystem-management-interrupt\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Boolean enabling the collection of the I/O System-Management Interrupt counter.
This option should only be used if the automated detection fails or if you want
to disable this feature.
.It \fBdigital-temperature-sensor\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Boolean enabling the collection of the temperature of each core.
This option should only be used if the automated detection fails or
if you want to disable this feature.
.It \fBpackage-thermal-management\fP \fItrue|false\fP
.It \fBrunning-average-power-limit\fP \fIbitmask\fP
Bit mask of the list of elements to be thermally monitored.
This option should only be used if the automated detection fails or if you want
to disable some collections.
The different bits of this bit mask accepted by this plugin are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fB0 ('1')\fP
Package
.It \fB1 ('2'):\fP
DRAM
.It \fB2 ('4'):\fP
Cores
.It \fB3 ('8'):\fP
Embedded graphic device
.El
.It \fBtcc-activation-temp\fP \fItemperature\fP
\fIThermal Control Circuit Activation Temperature\fP of the installed CPU.
This temperature is used when collecting the temperature of cores or packages.
This option should only be used if the automated detection fails.
Default value extracted from \f(CWMSR_IA32_TEMPERATURE_TARGET\fP.
.It \fBrestore-affinity-policy\fP \fIall-cpus|restore\fP
Reading data from CPU has side-effect: collectd process's CPU affinity mask
changes.
After reading data is completed, affinity mask needs to be restored.
This option allows to set restore policy.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBall-cpus\fP
Restore the affinity by setting affinity to any/all CPUs.
The default.
.It \fBRestore\fP
Save affinity using
.Fn sched_getaffinity
before reading data and restore it after.
.Pp
On some systems,
.Fn sched_getaffinity
will fail due to inconsistency of the CPU set size between userspace and kernel.
In these cases plugin will detect the unsuccessful call and fail with an error,
preventing data collection.
Most of configurations does not need to save affinity as ncollectd process is
allowed to run on any/all available CPUs.
.Pp
If you need to save and restore affinity and get errors like 'Unable to save
the CPU affinity', setting 'possible_cpus' kernel boot option may also help.
