NCOLLECTD-UUID(5) - File Formats Manual

# NAME

**ncollectd-uuid** - Documentation of ncollectd's uuid plugin

# SYNOPSIS

	load-plugin uuid
	plugin uuid {
	    uuid-file path
	}

# DESCRIPTION

The **uuid** plugin if loaded, causes the Hostname to be taken from
the machine's UUID.
The UUID is a universally unique designation for the machine, usually
taken from the machine's BIOS.
This is most useful if the machine is running in a virtual environment
such as Xen, in which case the UUID is preserved across shutdowns and
migration.

The following methods are used to find the machine's UUID, in order:

*	Check */etc/uuid* (or **uuid-file**).

*	Check for UUID from HAL (
	[http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal)
	) if present.

*	Check for UUID from Xen hypervisor.

*	If no UUID can be found then the hostname is not modified.

The plugin has de following options:

**uuid-file** *path*

> Take the UUID from the given file (default */etc/uuid*).
