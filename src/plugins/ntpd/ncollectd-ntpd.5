.Sh DESCRIPTION
The \fBntpd\fP plugin collects per-peer ntp data such as time offset and time
dispersion.
.Pp
For talking to \fBntpd\fP, it mimics what the \fBntpdc\fP control program does
on the wire - using \fBmode 7\fP specific requests.
This mode is deprecated with newer \fBntpd\fP releases (4.2.7p230 and later).
For the \fBntpd\fP plugin to work correctly with them, the ntp daemon must be
explicitly configured to enable \fBmode 7\fP (which is disabled by default).
Refer to the
.Xr ntp.conf 5
manual page for details.
.Pp
The configuration of the \fBntpd\fP plugin consists of one or more
\fBinstance\fP blocks.
Each block requires one string argument as the instance name.
.Pp
The following options are accepted within each \fBinstance\fP block:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBhost\fP \fIhost\fP
Hostname of the host running \fBntpd\fP.
Defaults to \fBlocalhost\fP.
.It \fBport\fP \fIport\fP
UDP port to connect to.
Defaults to \fB123\fP.
.It \fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics.
.It \fBinterval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from
this instance.
.It \fBreverse-lookups\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Sets whether or not to perform reverse lookups on peers.
Since the name or IP-address may be used in a filename it is recommended
to disable reverse lookups.
The default is to do reverse lookups to preserve backwards compatibility,
though.
.It \fBinclude-unit-id\fP \fItrue|false\fP
When a peer is a refclock, include the unit ID in the \fIpeer\fP label.
Defaults to \fBfalse\fP.
If two refclock peers use the same driver and this is \fBfalse\fP, the plugin
will try to write simultaneous measurements from both to the same type instance.
This will result in error messages in the log and only one set of measurements
making it through.
.It \fBfilter\fP
Configure a filter to modify or drop the metrics.
