.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBntpd\fP plugin collects per-peer ntp data such as time offset and time
dispersion.
.PP
For talking to \fBntpd\fP, it mimics what the \fBntpdc\fP control program does on
the wire - using \fBmode 7\fP specific requests. This mode is deprecated with
newer \fBntpd\fP releases (4.2.7p230 and later). For the \fBntpd\fP plugin to work
correctly with them, the ntp daemon must be explicitly configured to
enable \fBmode 7\fP (which is disabled by default). Refer to the
.BR ntp.conf (5)
manual page for details.
.PP
The configuration of the \fBntpd\fP plugin consists of one or more
\fBinstance\fP blocks. Each block requires one string argument
as the instance name.
.PP
The following options are accepted within each \fBinstance\fP block:
.PP
.TP
\fBhost\fP \fIhost\fP
Hostname of the host running \fBntpd\fP. Defaults to \fBlocalhost\fP.
.TP
\fBport\fP \fIport\fP
UDP port to connect to. Defaults to \fB123\fP.
.TP
\fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics.
.TP
\fBinterval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this instance.
.TP
\fBreverse-lookups\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Sets whether or not to perform reverse lookups on peers. Since the name or
IP-address may be used in a filename it is recommended to disable reverse
lookups. The default is to do reverse lookups to preserve backwards
compatibility, though.
.TP
\fBinclude-unit-id\fP \fItrue|false\fP
When a peer is a refclock, include the unit ID in the \fIpeer\fP label.
Defaults to \fBfalse\fP.
If two refclock peers use the same driver and this is \fBfalse\fP, the plugin will
try to write simultaneous measurements from both to the same type instance.
This will result in error messages in the log and only one set of measurements
making it through.
.TP
\fBfilter\fP
Configure a filter to modify or drop the metrics. See \fBFILTER CONFIGURATION\fP in
.BR ncollectd.conf(5)
