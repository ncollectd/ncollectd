.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBvirt\fP plugin allows CPU, disk, network load and other metrics to be collected for
virtualized guests on the machine. The statistics are collected through libvirt.
Majority of metrics can be gathered without installing any additional software on guests,
especially ncollectd, which runs only on the host system.

In the \fBinstance\fP block only \fBconnection\fP is required.
The following options are accepted within each \fBinstance\fP block:
.TP
\fBconnection\fP \fIuri\fP
Connect to the hypervisor given by \fIuri\fP. For example if using Xen use:

    \fBconnection\fP "xen:///"

Details which URIs allowed are given at
.UR http://libvirt.org/uri.html
.UE
.TP
\fBdomain\fP [\fIincl|include|excl|exclude\fP] \fIdomain\fP
Select which domains collected.
.TP
\fBblock-device\fP [\fIincl|include|excl|exclude\fP] \fIdevice\fP
Select which block devices are collected.
.TP
\fBblock-device-format\fP \fItarget|source\fP
If \fBblock-device-format\fP is set to \fItarget\fP, the default, then the device name
seen by the guest will be used for reporting metrics.
This corresponds to the \f(CW<target>\fP node in the XML definition of the domain.

If \fBBlockDeviceFormat\fP is set to \fIsource\fP, then metrics will be reported
using the path of the source, e.g. an image file.
This corresponds to the \f(CW<source>\fP node in the XML definition of the domain.
.TP
\fBinterface-device\fP [\fIincl|include|excl|exclude\fP] \fIdevice\fP
Select which interface devices are collected.
.TP
\fBinterface-format\fP \fIname|address|number\fP
When the virt plugin logs interface data, it sets the name of the collected
data according to this setting. The default is to use the path as provided by
the hypervisor (the "dev" property of the target node), which is equal to
setting \fIname\fP.

\fIaddress\fP means use the interface's mac address. This is useful since the
interface path might change between reboots of a guest or across migrations.

\fInumber\fP means use the interface's number in guest.

\fBNote\fP: this option determines also what field will be used for
filtering over interface device (filter value in \fBinterface-device\fP
will be applied to name, address or number).  More info about filtering
interfaces can be found in the description of \fBinterface-device\fP.
.TP
\fBpersistent-notification\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Override default configuration to only send notifications when there is a change
in the lifecycle state of a domain. When set to true notifications will be sent
for every read cycle. Default is false. Does not affect the stats being dispatched.
.TP
\fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics.
.TP
\fBcollect\fP \fIflags\fP
.RS
.TP
\fBdisk\fP
Report extra statistics like number of flush operations and total
service time for read, write and flush operations. Requires libvirt API version
\fI0.9.5\fP or later.
.TP
\fBpcpu\fP
Report the physical user/system cpu time consumed by the hypervisor, per-vm.
Requires libvirt API version \fI0.9.11\fP or later.
.TP
\fBcpu_util\fP
Report CPU utilization per domain in percentage.
.TP
\fBdomain_state\fP
Report domain state and reason.
.TP
\fBperf\fP
Report performance monitoring events. To collect performance
metrics they must be enabled for domain and supported by the platform. Requires
libvirt API version \fI1.3.3\fP :or later.

Note: \fIperf\fP metrics can't be collected if \fIintel_rdt\fP plugin is enabled.
.TP
\fBvcpupin\fP
Report pinning of domain VCPUs to host physical CPUs.
.TP
\fBdisk_err\fP
Report disk errors if any occured. Requires libvirt API version \fI0.9.10\fP or later.
.TP
\fBfs_info\fP
Report file system information as a notification. Requires
libvirt API version \fI1.2.11\fP or later. Can be collected only if \fIGuest Agent\fP
is installed and configured inside VM. Make sure that installed \fIGuest Agent\fP
version supports retrieving  file system information.
.TP
\fBdisk_allocation\fP
Report 'disk_allocation' statistic for disk device.

Note: This statistic is only reported for disk devices with 'source' property available.
.TP
\fBdisk_capacity\fP
Report statistic for disk device.

Note: This statistic is only reported for disk devices with 'source' property available.
.TP
\fBdisk_physical\fP
Report statistic for disk device.

Note: This statistic is only reported for disk devices with 'source' property available.
.TP
\fBmemory\fP
Report statistics about memory usage details, provided
by libvirt virDomainMemoryStats() function.
.TP
\fBvcpu\fP
Report domain virtual CPUs utilisation.
.RE
.TP
\fBrefresh-interval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Refresh the list of domains and devices every \fIseconds\fP. The default is 60
seconds. Setting this to be the same or smaller than the \fIInterval\fP will cause
the list of domains and devices to be refreshed on every iteration.

Refreshing the devices in particular is quite a costly operation, so if your
virtualization setup is static you might consider increasing this. If this
option is set to 0, refreshing is disabled completely.
.TP
\fBinterval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this
instanced. By default the global \fBinterval\fP setting will be used.
.TP
\fBfilter\fP
Configure a filter to modify or drop the metrics. See \fBFILTER CONFIGURATION\fP in
.BR ncollectd.conf(5)
