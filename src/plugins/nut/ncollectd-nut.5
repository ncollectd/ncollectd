.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBnut\fP plugin collects uninterruptible power supply (UPS) statistics using
the Network UPS Tools (NUT). These statistics include basically everything NUT
will give us, including voltages, currents, power, frequencies, load, and temperatures.
.TP
\fBca-path\fP "\fI/path/to/certs/folder\fP"
If \fBverify-peer\fP is set to \fItrue\fP, this is required. Otherwise this is ignored.
The folder pointed at must contain certificate(s) named according to their hash.
Ex: XXXXXXXX.Y where X is the hash value of a cert and Y is 0. If name collisions
occur because two different certs have the same hash value, Y can be  incremented
in order to avoid conflict. To create a symbolic link to a certificate the following
command can be used from within the directory where the cert resides:
.EX

ln -s some.crt ./$(openssl x509 -hash -noout -in some.crt).0

.EE
Alternatively, the package openssl-perl provides a command \f(CWc_rehash\fP that will
generate links like the one described above for ALL certs in a given folder.
Example usage:
.EX

c_rehash /path/to/certs/folder

.EE
.TP
\fBinstance\fP \fIname\fP
.RS
.TP
\fBups\fP \fIupsname@hostname\fP[\fI:port\fP]
Add a UPS to ncollect data from.
.TP
\fBforce-ssl\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Stops connections from falling back to unsecured if an SSL connection
cannot be established. Defaults to \fIfalse\fP.
.TP
\fBverify-peer\fP \fItrue|false\fP
If set to \fItrue\fP, requires a \fBca-path\fP be provided. Will use the \fBca-path\fP to find
certificates to use as Trusted Certificates to validate a upsd server certificate.
If validation of the upsd server certificate fails, the connection will not be
established. If \fBforce-ssl\fP is undeclared or set to \fIfalse\fP,
setting \fBverify-peer\fP to true will override and set \fBforce-ssl\fP to \fItrue\fP.
.TP
\fBconnect-timeout\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the connect timeout.
By default, the configured \fBinterval\fP is used to set the timeout.
.TP
\fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics.
.TP
\fBinterval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this instance.
.TP
\fBfilter\fP
Configure a filter to modify or drop the metrics. See \fBFILTER CONFIGURATION\fP in
