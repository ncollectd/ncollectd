# NAME

**ncollectd-slurm** - Documentation of ncollectd's slurm plugin

# SYNOPSIS

	load-plugin slurm
	plugin slurm

# DESCRIPTION

The **slurm** plugin collects per-partition SLURM node and job state
information, as well as internal health statistics.
It takes no options.
It should run on a node that is capable of running the *sinfo* and
*squeue* commands, i.e. it has a running slurmd and a valid slurm.conf.
Note that this plugin needs the **globals** option set to **true** in
order to function properly.
