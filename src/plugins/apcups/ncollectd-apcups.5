.Sh DESCRIPTION
The \fBapcups\fP plugin connects to an instance of \fBapcupsd\fP to read
various statistics about a connected uninterruptible power supply (UPS),
such as voltage, load, etc.
.Pp
The configuration of the \fBapcups\fP plugin consists of one or more
\fBinstance\fP blocks.
Each block requires one string argument as the instance name.
The following options are accepted within each \fBinstance\fP block:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBhost\fP \fIhostname\fP
Hostname of the host running \fBapcupsd\fP.
Defaults to \fIlocalhost\fP.
Please note that IPv6 support has been disabled unless someone can confirm
or decline that \fBapcupsd\fP can handle it.
.It \fBport\fP \fIport\fP
TCP port to connect to.
Defaults to \fB3551\fP.
.It \fBpersistent-connection\fP \fItrue|false\fP
The plugin is designed to keep the connection to \fBapcupsd\fP open between
reads.
If plugin poll interval is greater than 15 seconds (hardcoded socket close
timeout in \fBapcupsd\fP NIS), then this option is \fIfalse\fP by default.
.Pp
You can instruct the plugin to close the connection after each read by setting
this option to \fIfalse\fP or force keeping the connection by setting it to
\fBtrue\fP.
.Pp
If \fBapcupsd\fP appears to close the connection due to inactivity quite
quickly, the plugin will try to detect this problem and switch to an
open-read-close mode.
.It \fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics.
.It \fBinterval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected.
By default the global \fBinterval\fP setting will be used.
