NCOLLECTD-CPUFREQ(5) - File Formats Manual

# NAME

**ncollectd-cpufreq** - Documentation of ncollectd's cpufreq plugin

# SYNOPSIS

	load-plugin cpufreq
	plugin cpufreq

# DESCRIPTION

The **cpufreq** plugin is available on Linux and FreeBSD only.
It doesn't have any options.
On Linux it reads
*/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling\_cur\_freq* (for the first CPU
installed) to get the current CPU frequency. If this file does not exist make
sure **cpufreqd** (
[http://cpufreqd.sourceforge.net](http://cpufreqd.sourceforge.net)
) or a similar tool is
installed and an "cpu governor" (that's a kernel module) is loaded.

On Linux, if the system has the *cpufreq-stats* kernel module loaded, this
plugin reports the rate of p-state (cpu frequency) transitions and the
percentage of time spent in each p-state.

On FreeBSD it does a sysctl dev.cpu.0.freq and submits this as instance 0.
At this time FreeBSD only has one frequency setting for all cores.
See the BUGS section in the FreeBSD man page for
cpufreq(4)
for more details.

On FreeBSD the plugin checks the success of sysctl dev.cpu.0.freq and
unregisters the plugin when this fails.  A message will be logged to indicate
this.
