.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsmart\fP plugin collects SMART information from physical
disks. Values collectd include temperature, power cycle count, poweron
time and bad sectors. Also, all SMART attributes are collected along
with the normalized current value, the worst value, the threshold and
a human readable value. The plugin can also collect SMART attributes
for NVMe disks (present in accordance with NVMe 1.4 spec) and Additional
SMART Attributes from IntelÂ® NVMe disks.
.PP
Using the following two options you can ignore some disks or configure the
collection only of specific disks.
.PP
.TP
\fBdisk\fP [\fIincl|include|excl|exclude\fP] \fBdisk-name\fP
Select the disk \fIdisk-name\fP to collect metrics.
If no \fBdisk\fP option is configured, all disks are collected.
See \fBINCLUDE AND EXCLUDE LISTS\fP in
.BR ncollectd.conf (5).
.TP
\fBserial\fP [\fIincl|include|excl|exclude\fP] \fBserial-number\fP
Select the disk serial number \fIserial-name\fP to collect metrics.
If no \fBserial\fP option is configured, all disks are collected.
See \fBINCLUDE AND EXCLUDE LISTS\fP in
.BR ncollectd.conf (5).
.TP
\fBignore-sleep-mode\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Normally, the \fBsmart\fP plugin will ignore disks that are reported to be asleep.
This option disables the sleep mode check and allows the plugin to collect data
from these disks anyway. This is useful in cases where libatasmart mistakenly
reports disks as asleep because it has not been updated to incorporate support
for newer idle states in the ATA spec.
