# DESCRIPTION

The **zookeeper** plugin will collect statistics from a *zookeeper*
server using the *mntr* command.
It requires Zookeeper 3.4.0+ and access to the client port.

The plugin configuration consists of one or more **instance** blocks which
specify one *zookeper* connection each.
Within the **instance** blocks, the following options are allowed:

**host** *host*

> Hostname or address to connect to.
> Defaults to localhost.

**port** *service*

> Service name or port number to connect to.
> Defaults to 2181.

**label** *key* *value*

> Append the label *key*=*value* to the submitting metrics.

**interval** *interval*

> Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this
> instance.
> By default the global **interval** setting will be used.

**filter**

> Configure a filter to modify or drop the metrics.
> See **FILTER CONFIGURATION** in
> ncollectd.conf(5).
