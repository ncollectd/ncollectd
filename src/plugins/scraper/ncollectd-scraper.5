.SH DESCRIPTION
The scraper plugin collect metrics from a http endpoint.
.PP
.TP
\fBurl\fP \fIurl\fP
URL of the web site to retrieve the metrics.
.TP
\fBuser\fP \fIusername\fP
Username to use if authorization is required to read the page.
.TP
\fBpassword\fP \fIpassword\fP
Password to use if authorization is required to read the page.
.TP
\fBdigest\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Enable HTTP digest authentication.
.TP
\fBverify-peer\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Enable or disable peer SSL certificate verification. See
.UR http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
.UE
for details. Enabled by default.
.TP
\fBverify-host\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Enable or disable peer host name verification. If enabled, the plugin checks if
the \f(CWCommon Name\fP or a \f(CWSubject Alternate Name\fP field of the SSL certificate
matches the host name provided by the \fBurl\fP option. If this identity check
fails, the connection is aborted. Obviously, only works when connecting to a
SSL enabled server. Enabled by default.
.TP
\fBca-cert\fP \fI/path/to/ca-cert\fP
File that holds one or more SSL certificates. If you want to use HTTPS you will
possibly need this option. What CA certificates come bundled with \fBlibcurl\fP
and are checked by default depends on the distribution you use.
.TP
\fBheader\fP \fIheader\fP
A HTTP header to add to the request. Multiple headers are added if this option
is specified more than once.
.TP
\fBpost\fP \fIdata\fP
Specifies that the HTTP operation should be a POST instead of a GET. The
complete data to be posted is given as the argument.  This option will usually
need to be accompanied by a \fBheader\fP option to set an appropriate
\f(CWContent-Type\fP for the post body (e.g. to \f(CWapplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\fP).
.TP
\fBinterval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this
instanced. By default the global \fBinterval\fP setting will be used.
.TP
\fBtimeout\fP \fIseconds\fP
The \fBtimeout\fP option sets the overall timeout for HTTP requests to \fBurl\fP, in
seconds. By default, the configured \fBinterval\fP is used to set the
timeout.
If \fBtimeout\fP is bigger than the \fBinterval\fP, keep in mind that each slow
network connection will stall one read thread. Adjust the \fBread-threads\fP global
setting accordingly to prevent this from blocking other plugins.
.TP
\fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics. Can appear
multiple time in the \fBinstance\fP block.
.TP
\fBmetric-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prepends \fIprefix\fP to the metric name in the \fBmatch\fP.
.TP
\fBcollect\fP \fIflags\fP
.RS
.TP
\fBtotal_time\fP
Total time of the transfer, including name resolving, TCP connect, etc.
.TP
\fBnamelookup_time\fP
Time it took from the start until name resolving was completed.
.TP
\fBconnect_time\fP
Time it took from the start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy)
was completed.
.TP
\fBpretransfer_time\fP
Time it took from the start until just before the transfer begins.
.TP
\fBsize_upload\fP
The total amount of bytes that were uploaded.
.TP
\fBsize_download\fP
The total amount of bytes that were downloaded.
.TP
\fBspeed_download\fP
The average download speed that curl measured for the complete download.
.TP
\fBspeed_upload\fP
The average upload speed that curl measured for the complete upload.
.TP
\fBheader_size\fP
The total size of all the headers received.
.TP
\fBrequest_size\fP
The total size of the issued requests.
.TP
\fBcontent_length_download\fP
The content-length of the download.
.TP
\fBcontent_length_upload\fP
The specified size of the upload.
.TP
\fBstarttransfer_time\fP
Time it took from the start until the first byte was received.
.TP
\fBredirect_time\fP
Time it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect,
pre-transfer and transfer before final transaction was started.
.TP
\fBredirect_count\fP
The total number of redirections that were actually followed.
.TP
\fBnum_connects\fP
The number of new connections that were created to achieve the transfer.
.TP
\fBappconnect_time\fP
Time it took from the start until the SSL connect/handshake to the remote
host was completed.
.RE
.TP
\fBfilter\fP
Configure a filter to modify or drop the metrics. See \fBFILTER CONFIGURATION\fP in
