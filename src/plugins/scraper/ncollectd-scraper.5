.Sh DESCRIPTION
The scraper plugin collect metrics from a http endpoint.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBurl\fP \fIurl\fP
URL of the web site to retrieve the metrics.
.It \fBuser\fP \fIusername\fP
Username to use if authorization is required to read the page.
.It \fBuser-env\fP \fIenv-name\fP
Get the username to use if authorization is required to read the page from the
environment variable \fIenv-name\fP.
.It \fBpassword\fP \fIpassword\fP
Password to use if authorization is required to read the page.
.It \fBpassword-env\fP \fIenv-name\fP
Get the password to use if authorization is required to read the page from the
environment variable \fIenv-name\fP.
.It \fBdigest\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Enable HTTP digest authentication.
.It \fBverify-peer\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Enable or disable peer SSL certificate verification.
See
.Lk http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
for details.
Enabled by default.
.It \fBverify-host\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Enable or disable peer host name verification.
If enabled, the plugin checks if the \f(CWCommon Name\fP or a
\f(CWSubject Alternate Name\fP field of the SSL certificate matches the host
name provided by the \fBurl\fP option.
If this identity check fails, the connection is aborted.
Obviously, only works when connecting to a SSL enabled server.
Enabled by default.
.It \fBca-cert\fP \fI/path/to/ca-cert\fP
File that holds one or more SSL certificates.
If you want to use HTTPS you will possibly need this option.
What CA certificates come bundled with \fBlibcurl\fP and are checked by default
depends on the distribution you use.
.It \fBheader\fP \fIheader\fP
A HTTP header to add to the request.
Multiple headers are added if this option is specified more than once.
.It \fBpost\fP \fIdata\fP
Specifies that the HTTP operation should be a POST instead of a GET.
The complete data to be posted is given as the argument.
This option will usually need to be accompanied by a \fBheader\fP
option to set an appropriate \f(CWContent-Type\fP for the post
body (e.g. to \f(CWapplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\fP).
.It \fBinterval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this
instanced.
By default the global \fBinterval\fP setting will be used.
.It \fBtimeout\fP \fIseconds\fP
The \fBtimeout\fP option sets the overall timeout for HTTP requests
to \fBurl\fP, in seconds.
By default, the configured \fBinterval\fP is used to set the timeout.
If \fBtimeout\fP is bigger than the \fBinterval\fP, keep in mind that each slow
network connection will stall one read thread.
Adjust the \fBread-threads\fP global setting accordingly to prevent this from
blocking other plugins.
.It \fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics.
Can appear multiple time in the \fBinstance\fP block.
.It \fBmetric-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prepends \fIprefix\fP to the metric name in the \fBmatch\fP.
.It \fBcollect\fP \fIflags\fP
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBtotal_time\fP
Total time of the transfer, including name resolving, TCP connect, etc.
.It \fBnamelookup_time\fP
Time it took from the start until name resolving was completed.
.It \fBconnect_time\fP
Time it took from the start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy)
was completed.
.It \fBpretransfer_time\fP
Time it took from the start until just before the transfer begins.
.It \fBsize_upload\fP
The total amount of bytes that were uploaded.
.It \fBsize_download\fP
The total amount of bytes that were downloaded.
.It \fBspeed_download\fP
The average download speed that curl measured for the complete download.
.It \fBspeed_upload\fP
The average upload speed that curl measured for the complete upload.
.It \fBheader_size\fP
The total size of all the headers received.
.It \fBrequest_size\fP
The total size of the issued requests.
.It \fBcontent_length_download\fP
The content-length of the download.
.It \fBcontent_length_upload\fP
The specified size of the upload.
.It \fBstarttransfer_time\fP
Time it took from the start until the first byte was received.
.It \fBredirect_time\fP
Time it took for all redirection steps include name lookup, connect,
pre-transfer and transfer before final transaction was started.
.It \fBredirect_count\fP
The total number of redirections that were actually followed.
.It \fBnum_connects\fP
The number of new connections that were created to achieve the transfer.
.It \fBappconnect_time\fP
Time it took from the start until the SSL connect/handshake to the remote
host was completed.
.El
.It \fBfilter\fP
Configure a filter to modify or drop the metrics.
