ncollectd-interface \- Documentation of ncollectd's interface plugin
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBload-plugin\fP interface
.br
\fBplugin\fP interface {
    \fBinterface\fP [\fIincl|include|excl|exclude\fP] \fIinterface\fP
    \fBreport-inactive\fP \fItrue|false\fP
    \fBunique-name\fP \fItrue|false\fP
.br
}
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBinterface\fP plugin collects information about the traffic,
packets per second and errors of interfaces. If you're not interested in all interfaces
but want to exclude some, or only collect information of some selected interfaces,
you can select the “interesting” interfaces using the plugin's configuration.
.PP
The plugin support the following options:
.PP
.TP
\fBinterface\fP [\fIincl|include|excl|exclude\fP] \fIinterface\fP
If no configuration is given, the \fBinterface\fP plugin will collect data from
all interfaces. This may not be practical, especially for loopback and
similar interfaces. Thus, you can use the \fBinterface\fP option to pick the
interfaces you're interested in. Sometimes, however, it's easier/preferred
to collect all interfaces \fIexcept\fP a few ones.
See \fBINCLUDE AND EXCLUDE LISTS\fP in
.BR ncollectd.conf (5).
.TP
\fBreport-inactive\fP \fItrue|false\fP
When set to \fIfalse\fP, only interfaces with non-zero traffic will be
reported. Note that the check is done by looking into whether a
package was sent at any time from boot and the corresponding counter
is non-zero. So, if the interface has been sending data in the past
since boot, but not during the reported time-interval, it will still
be reported.

The default value is \fItrue\fP and results in collection of the data
from all interfaces that are selected by \fBinterface\fP.
.TP
\fBunique-name\fP \fItrue|false\fP
Interface name is not unique on Solaris (KSTAT), interface name is unique
only within a module/instance. Following tuple is considered unique:
 (ks_module, ks_instance, ks_name)
If this option is set to true, interface name contains above three fields
separated by an underscore.

This option is only available on Solaris.
