.Sh DESCRIPTION
The \fBsigrok\fP plugin uses \fIlibsigrok\fP to retrieve measurements
from any device supported by the sigrok project.
.Pp
The plugin supports the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBlog-level\fP \fIlevel\fP
The \fIsigrok\fP logging level to pass on to the ncollectd log, as a number
between \fB0\fP and \fB5\fP (inclusive). These levels correspond to \fINone\fP,
\fIErrors\fP, \fIWarnings\fP, \fIInformational\fP, \fIDebug\fP and \fISpew\fP,
respectively.
The default is \fB2\fP (\fIWarnings\fP). The \fIsigrok\fP log messages,
regardless of their level, are always submitted to ncollectd at its
INFO log level.
.It \fBdevice\fP \fIname\fP
A sigrok-supported device, uniquely identified by this section's options.
The \fIname\fP is passed to ncollectd as the \fIdevice\fP label.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \fBdriver\fP \fIdriver\fP
The sigrok driver to use for this device.
.It \fBconn\fP \fIconnection-spec\fP
If the device cannot be auto-discovered, or more than one might be discovered
by the driver, \fIconnection-spec\fP specifies the connection string to the
device.
It can be of the form of a device path (e.g. \fI/dev/ttyUSB2\fP), or, in
case of a non-serial USB-connected device, the USB
\fIVendorID\fP\fB.\fP\fIProductID\fP separated by a period
(e.g. \f(CW0403.6001\fP).
A USB device can also be specified as \fIBus\fP\fB.\fP\fIAddress\fP
(e.g. \f(CW1.41\fP).
.It \fBserial-comm\fP \fIserial-device\fP
For serial devices with non-standard port settings, this option can be used
to specify them in a form understood by \fIsigrok\fP, e.g. \f(CW9600/8n1\fP.
This should not be necessary; drivers know how to communicate with devices they
support.
.It \fBminimum-interval\fP \fIseconds\fP
Specifies the minimum time between measurement dispatches to ncollectd, in
seconds.
Since some \fIsigrok\fP supported devices can acquire measurements many
times per second, it may be necessary to throttle these.
.Pp
The default \fBminimum-interval\fP is \fB0\fP, meaning measurements received
from the device are always dispatched to ncollectd.
When throttled, unused measurements are discarded.
.It \fBmetric-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prepends \fIprefix\fP to the metric name.
.It \fBchannel\fP \fIchannel\fP
Send only metrics for this \fIchannel\fP name.
It can appear multiple times.
By default, it shows all channels if not set.
.It \fBlabel\fP \fIkey\fP \fIvalue\fP
Append the label \fIkey\fP=\fIvalue\fP to the submitting metrics.
Can appear multiple times in the \fBdevice\fP block.
